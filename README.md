# GraphAlgorithms

## Overview
This repository is meant for introducing beginners to the world of Graph Algorithms in Java.

It contains a simple implementation of the most commonly used graph traversal algorithms BFS (Breadth-First-Search) & DFS (Depth-First-Search) for your own personal learning and exploration. 

For the beginners that want to take it a step further, it also contains an implementation of the famous Metaheuristic algorithm, A* search. It is known to perform better than BFS on average, which performs better than DFS on average.

## Execution Instructions

First compile the class by running:

```javac GraphAlgorithms.java```

Then execute the Java Bytecode with:

```java GraphAlgorithms```
